# Web-scrabing-using-python

In this repo we are going to scrab the display ads from the website(part1) and after that we are going to extract the text and images from the dsplay ads

Please install all the packages in requirement.txt file
# Part 1
In this part we only have to privide the url of your website
And we are using BeautifulSoup for this
And then work is done

Program print the url of the images

These images later on used in part 2 to extract text and logos

Both the function can be combined in a single .py file,but the this repo I have done in two parts.

# Part 2
For extracting the text we are going to use the pytesseract lib of python.

You only have  to provide location of your img or the url of the display ad that we have got in part1
Like this 
img2 = cv2.imread('photo3.jpg')

Then this program print the text from the images
and show the image with bounding box around the text.



# Thanks
